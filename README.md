# Tech Skills Portfolio

This repository showcases a variety of sample projects that demonstrate my skills in software testing, automation, and development.

- In the *JAVA/Simple_Dice_Game* folder, you‚Äôll find a simple dice game featuring a ü¶∏ **Hero** and üê≤ **Monsters**. The objective is to defeat the üëπ **Boss Monster** step by step as you progress across the fields. This *little fun gem*, developed in **Java**, showcases basic object-oriented programming principles.

- In the *Test_Automation/Project_Recipe_Blog* folder, you'll find the results of a üñ•Ô∏è demonstration project. During this project, I tested a *recipe blog*. Automated tests were implemented using a **POM (Page Object Model)** structure in **Python**, with **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation. API testing was performed using **Postman**. The results were visualized in a **CI process** through **GitHub Actions**, using **Allure Reporter** for reporting. **SQL** database analysis was also conducted during the testing. As I worked in a **Dockerized** localhost environment, the **JMeter** performance tests and **ZAP** penetration tests serve only as a demonstration of how these tools operate. The tests were documented in **Jira**, and the manual tests were executed using **Zephyr**.

   *(My work was supported by a team member due to the large volume of tasks.)*
